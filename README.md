The laguages of this repo could vary from go, python, javascript, typescript, sql, perl, rust, shell, elm, perl, etc. Whatever I wanna try you'll find here.

This is a repo which holds all my solutions to the katas I do on the coding_wars and solutions to other algo problems, like the solutions I posted for the free code camp Coding Interview Prep.
